# QtMips builds for macOS by pokusew


## Versions

* [qtmips-macos-v0.6.8.zip](https://github.com/pokusew/devbuntu/raw/master/qtmips-builds/qtmips-macos-v0.6.8.zip)

## Usage

In order to run the build,
**please install Qt 5 https://www.qt.io/ locally**,
as it is not included in the build (it is linked dynamically).

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Qt. Run:
```bash
brew install qt
```

Then you can just **extract the zip** file wherever you want and then you can **just run `qtmips_gui.app`**.  
**Note:** Maybe you see a security warning that prevents you from running the app.
_In such case_, click on the app with the **right button**, select _Open_ and then you should see an option to run the app despite the warnings.
Once you run the app, the security warnings won't appear anymore.
